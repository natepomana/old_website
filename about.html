        <p class="lead">Hola, welcome to my site! I'm Nathan Pomana, and I'm currently a first-year student at Rochester Institute of Technology. 
		Currently I'm in Computing Exploration (undeclared in computing), and plan on getting a degree in Human Computing Interaction, or HCI for short. 
		If all goes according to plan, I should graduate in May of 2020, not 2019 due to mandatory co-ops to get work experience.

	Now, I could tell you that I have all of these amazing character traits, and my favorite shows are "Big Bang Theory", "The Walking Dead", and 
	"The Office", and my favorite color is a vibrant orange, but that doesn't describe me on my personality and all. Instead, it would be more easier to 
	say that I'm a ENFJ. What's an ENFJ? An ENFJ (extended) means Extraverted iNtuitive Feeling Judging. If you aren't aware of Carl G. Jung's theory of 
	psychological types, people can be explained by their preference of general attitude. It's quite interesting, as I believe it describes me very well, 
	being an ENFJ. To put it in a different perspective, some fameous people who are also ENFJ are Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela, John Paul II, 
	Morgan Freeman, and Oprah Winfrey, to name a few.

	The purpose of this site is for you to get a feel of who I am, and maybe someday meet you in person! Feel free to browse around and check me out, 
	feel free to contact me at npomana@outlook.com and I'll get back to you as soon as possible!</p>
